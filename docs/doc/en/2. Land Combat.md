## Overview

This document explains the modeling rationale behind **melee combat mechanics** shared by land and naval combat in the Calculator.  
All content represents independent research results and has not been officially verified.  
For authoritative descriptions, please refer to the official documentation; relevant sections can be found [here](https://wiki.callofwar.com/wiki/COMBAT#Melee_combat).

## Land Melee Combat

Based on inference from observable behavior, any combat engagement in CoW necessarily involves at least one **Attacker** and one **Defender**.  
However, offensive and defensive damage outputs are *asymmetric in scope*:

- The Attacker’s damage calculation targets **all valid enemy Stacks** within the engagement scope.
- The Defender’s retaliatory damage is calculated only within a **local Damage Context** and is restricted to the corresponding single attacking Stack.

In typical land melee combat, there is exactly one Attacker and one Defender.  
Within a single combat tick, only **one attack action and one retaliation action** occur between two opposing Stacks.  
This interaction can be described as:

> **A single Damage Context generated between two Stacks**

The generation of a Damage Context is **directional** (e.g., `Stack A → Stack B`).  
Each attack direction produces an independent Damage Context.

## Bilateral Symmetric Offensive Engagement

In CoW, when two neutral or hostile armies come into contact while moving, or when the defending player performs an operation that updates the army state during a standard land melee encounter, **both sides participate as Attackers** in damage resolution.  
In such cases, there is no Defender in the traditional sense [²](6.%20References.md#²).

Instead, both attack and retaliation outputs are resolved by generating **two Damage Contexts**, which are:

- executed according to **Context-level serialized execution rules**  
- evaluated within the same resolution window  
- and take effect simultaneously at the semantic level

Although naval units generally have identical attack and retaliation values, **all naval melee combat** can be treated as a special case of **bilateral symmetric offensive engagement** [³](6.%20References.md#³).
