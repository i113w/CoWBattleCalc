## Overview

This document describes the modeling rationale behind **air combat** and **air-to-ground / air-to-sea combat** mechanics in the Calculator.  
All content represents independent research results and has not been officially verified.  
For authoritative references, please consult the official documentation, including  
[Air Combat](https://wiki.callofwar.com/wiki/COMBAT#Air_combat) and  
[Attacking vs. Defending](https://wiki.callofwar.com/wiki/COMBAT#Attacking_vs._Defending).

## Patrol

When selecting standard aircraft, a `Patrol` command is typically available.  
In the Chinese community, this behavior is often referred to as “circling” or “patrol attack”; in this document, the term **Patrol** is used consistently to match the in-game terminology.

According to official definitions, aircraft in Patrol mode perform damage resolution once every 15 minutes.  
During each resolution:

- the aircraft receives **50% retaliatory damage**, and  
- deals **50% attack damage** [⁴](6.%20References.md#⁴).

The outer ring of the aircraft’s vision range (i.e., `5/3` of its View Range) constitutes its effective attack range.  
At the end of each Patrol interval, the aircraft generates **one Damage Context** against all **hostile units** within range.

For province morale and buildings, damage is typically applied **only to the province in which the aircraft is currently patrolling**.

## Air Combat

In direct air-to-air attacks (i.e., one aircraft attacking another), the combat mechanism mirrors that of land combat:  
a single Damage Context is generated, within which attack and retaliation damage are calculated and applied.

However, when **both aircraft are patrolling**, the **order in which Patrol intervals end** affects damage resolution order.  
The aircraft whose Patrol ends first generates its Damage Context first.  
Since an aircraft’s attack damage is generally higher than its retaliation damage, the aircraft whose Patrol ends later will:

1. first receive retaliatory damage, then  
2. perform its own attack

This results in reduced damage efficiency for the latter aircraft, producing the commonly observed **first-mover advantage**.

## Air-to-Ground / Air-to-Sea Combat

When an aircraft attacks a non-air target (including ground or naval units), the Damage Context is resolved differently.

In this scenario:

- the ground or naval target **resolves its retaliatory damage first**
- the aircraft’s state (e.g., HP, damage efficiency) is updated immediately
- only then is the aircraft’s attack damage calculated and applied

As a consequence, if the target’s `vs. Airplane` damage exceeds the aircraft’s total HP, the aircraft will be destroyed **without dealing any attack damage**.

## Observed Properties

Community testing has revealed the following behaviors:

- When an aircraft stationed on the ground (including transport truck state) is directly attacked by another aircraft, **no retaliatory damage is dealt**.
- When an aircraft stationed on the ground is attacked by a non-air unit, and other ground units are present at the same location, the aircraft **does not share incoming damage** with ground units.  
  Instead, the aircraft receives the attacker’s **full `vs. Airplane` damage**.

  For example, when a level-1 *Allies* Cruiser bombards a province containing both an infantry Stack and an aircraft Stack on the ground, the Cruiser deals:
  - 1.5 damage to the infantry Stack, and
  - 6 damage to the aircraft Stack.
