Based on the author’s own testing, even when one side’s naval units remain completely stationary,
once the opposing side enters engagement range and combat is triggered,
**two Damage Contexts are generated**.
As a result, combat progresses significantly faster than the idealized
“one attack, one defense” model would suggest.

This behavior has been observed, for example, when submarines attack transport ships during landing.
Although landing is defined in the CoW Wiki as a state in which units are
“only able to counterattack,”
the actual combat resolution still produces two active damage directions.

Community testing has repeatedly shown that, **in the past**, players were able to significantly weaken
or even bypass the effects of SBDE on damage output in Blob counterattack scenarios
by splitting defending forces into multiple Stacks.

However, in community tests conducted around the 2025-era versions of the game,
this behavior can no longer be reliably reproduced.
Current observations indicate that, during Blob counterattack resolution,
SBDE is applied uniformly at the **Army level** across all participating defenders,
regardless of whether they are split into multiple Stacks.

After the period in which the exploit could no longer be reproduced,
the *Call of War Wiki* added the following explanation in the
*Attacking vs. Defending* section:

```text
Attacks always target all enemy armies in a radius of 5 around the main target,
the attack damage gets split among these targeted armies.
Thus all enemy armies in this radius become defenders.
The defense damage of all defenders in the area is summed up before stack limits are applied,
to prevent advantages from splitting troops.
```
